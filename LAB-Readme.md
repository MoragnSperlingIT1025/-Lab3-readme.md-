# Python IDLE
  File editor is used to edit, debug, and run the code and shell is not where you code is where the end product is shown and has the triple bracket.
  
## Code Examples
 #### i. A Varible is a box that can store values. Spam, bacon, eggs are used as varibles because of monty phyton.  
 #### ii. An assignment statement is where you get the varible a value.
 #### iii. A function is a block of code to perform one action.
 #### iv. The three value types are intergers(int) which ase numbers, floating(float) point numbers are number with decimals, and strings           which are for text value.


# Graphics
 
  Raster is a type of image that is made of thousands to millions tiny little pixels, when you view this type of image its original size   the pixels are too small to see but when you zoom in you are able to see the pixels versus a vector image you can enlarge or minimize     with the quality being the same as the original, they are rendered using a more complex process.  
  
  
  
  Lossy compression means all the data from the original data from the orginal file and saves the image with a reduced file size.
  Lossless compression are used by using run-length encoding, which takes runs of data, and stores them as a single value and count,     this is best used for simple graphics. It matters to developers because this all the effects the quality of the photo. 
  
  GIF allows animated images, which can not be done on jpg and png. GIF supports up to 8 bits per pixel. JPEG is a image format that     usued lossy compression. The developer is able to fine-tune this image, which results in a better quality images. PNG is bitmapped     image that uses lossless data compression and was created to replace GIF. This type of image was not widely support by internet         explorer, no it is supported

## File Properties
  
  My image only has on layer, it was really simple. My logo is an I of internet and it is purple.
  
  The size of my logo is 788 bytes. My image has been opening with internet explorer. The only recommendations I have is Chrome and       Interner Explorer. This probably due to its large size.  

# Lucidchart
  
  Lucidchart can be a very useful tool in the workplace. This software is used to make flowchart to further explain ideas and concpets.   Our assignment was to make a flow chart of a computer program to have the ouput of big anf small if the number was larger than 10 or   smaller than 10. I can really see how this can be used for more complex situations. 

# Introduction to Networking


  ## Data Transmission
  
  Packet- Unit of data 
  Packet- Switching-Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
  IP Address- Unique identifying number 
  DNS- Directory of IP address common names.Â For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
  Protocol- Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
  
  ## Networking Hardware
  
  Hub does not filter data or has any input of where the data needs to be sent. The hub gets the data and rebroadcasts it to all the     other ports that it is connected to. Switch though very similar, it is intelligent. Meaning it can learn the physical addresses of     where information needs to be sent. When a packet is sent to a switch the inforamtion is only sent to it intended desination.
  
  A router is used to send data outside their own network to another network by being able to read IP addresses. A router is essential   the gateway to the network.
  
  ## Network Topologies
  
  Single point of failure is when a hub or switch fails and all communication between computers fail and the entire network goes down. This uses the star, bus, and ring topology. Mesh topology is where all the computers are connected it handles failure very well. It Creates a high redundacy level becuase if one of the computers fail it will still able to communicate because all of the connections. It is used mostly for the internet. Infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices.  I think mesh topology would be the best to used because of its high redundacy.
 
 ## Network Design
 
 My network is simple it starts from the could then goes through a firewall. Then through the router to the server then the switch to different computers within the same network. I relied heavily on the example because I was unsure of the task. 
 
 ## NSA/CSS
 
The NSA's role is U.S. cybersecurity is to defend and protect securtiy systems in the US. This includes military, and intelligence. NSA is also responible for the protection of US government information systems and communications.
