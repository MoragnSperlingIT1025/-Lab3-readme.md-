# Python IDLE
  File editor is used to edit, debug, and run the code and shell is not where you code is where the end product is shown and has the triple bracket.
  
## Code Examples
 #### i. A Varible is a box that can store values. Spam, bacon, eggs are used as varibles because of monty phyton.  
 #### ii. An assignment statement is where you get the varible a value.
 #### iii. A function is a block of code to perform one action.
 #### iv. The three value types are intergers(int) which ase numbers, floating(float) point numbers are number with decimals, and strings           which are for text value.


# Graphics
 
  Raster is a type of image that is made of thousands to millions tiny little pixels, when you view this type of image its original size   the pixels are too small to see but when you zoom in you are able to see the pixels versus a vector image you can enlarge or minimize     with the quality being the same as the original, they are rendered using a more complex process.  
  
  
  
  Lossy compression means all the data from the original data from the orginal file and saves the image with a reduced file size.
  Lossless compression are used by using run-length encoding, which takes runs of data, and stores them as a single value and count,     this is best used for simple graphics. It matters to developers because this all the effects the quality of the photo. 
  
  GIF allows animated images, which can not be done on jpg and png. GIF supports up to 8 bits per pixel. JPEG is a image format that     usued lossy compression. The developer is able to fine-tune this image, which results in a better quality images. PNG is bitmapped     image that uses lossless data compression and was created to replace GIF. This type of image was not widely support by internet         explorer, no it is supported

## File Properties
  
  My image only has on layer, it was really simple. My logo is an I of internet and it is purple.
  
  The size of my logo is 788 bytes. My image has been opening with internet explorer. The only recommendations I have is Chrome and       Interner Explorer. This probably due to its large size.
